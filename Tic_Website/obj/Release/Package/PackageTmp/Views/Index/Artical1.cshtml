        Hi everybody! My name is Anna.I am from Austria and currently studying in the UK.
        As I love Chinese culture, Idecided to go to China insummer 2014.
        Because of my experience there, I am now working with my friends for a start-up project
        providing tourism services to foreigners(especially students) in China.
    </p>
    
    <p class="Artical1">
            Travelling in China was mind-blowing and was
            so much more than I would have been able to
            imagine. When people ask me about China after
            my return to the UK, I always summarized my
            travel experiencein three words: <B>fascinating, challenging, inspiring</B>.
    </p>

    <p class="Artical1">
        Fascinating because of the cultural differences.
        People are so differentin the way they think, how
        they act, and how they treat each other. <B>Most
        Chinese people avoid conversations with you
        because they can’t speak English</B>.
        Yet thosewho realise you speak Chinese
        ortry out their English with you
        turn out to be the friendliest and warmest
        people.

        </p>
    <p class="Artical1">
        ‘Challenging’ is because of the huge language barrier and thelogistical difficulties. 
        Without those, travelling in China would have beena lot easier! When I arrived in Shanghai 
        at 11pm on a weekday, the airport was absolutely empty. I was stuck, with <B> possibility of 
        getting reasonable affordable transport into the city centre!</B>

        <p class="Artical1">
            I often arrived at hostels, just to find out that <B>my booking has been cancelled due to misunderstandings</B>. 
            After some wordless discussions using gestures and hand signs, 
            I would get squeezed into a dorm filled with snoring, sweating guests.To make matters worse, 
            <B>most restaurants had no English food menu!</B> This unfortunatelyled to my encounterwith chicken legs, 
            indescribable dishes, and many sleepless nights of stomach ache. 
            If it wasn’t for my complete fascination with China, I would have been completely exhausted and frustrated. 
            This is such a shame, considering China’s rich cultural heritage, astonishing landscapes, and friendly people.

            Given my travel experience, I felt inspired to find a way to show more internationalstudents 
            what China is really like. I met some Chinese and international students in my universitywho 
            felt the same way. We did an initial market analysis and were quitesurprised by the demand of 
            tailored tourism services for international studentsin China.
        </p>
        <p class="Artical1">
            And so, wedecided to merge our ideas and cooperate. We strive to create <B>
            a unique English speaking tourism companythat offers a range of services to international 
            students in China</B>. 
            By doing this project, we wish to build a bridge between our cultures that transcendsthe 
            language barrier and make travelling in China easier, more available,and more enjoyable.
